### Warnings and Potential gotchas
- This uses watir to launch a test chrome browser. This can be difficult to install on some platforms. While the browser automation is running, it is best to avoid interacting with the launched browser until it shuts down after logging-in.
- Chrome is only launched conditionally (once in two days or if the ```unifi_cookies.yml``` is not found on local dir). 
- This bears repeating: **Please do not share your unifi_cookies.yml or your checker.yml file with anyone since they contain private login information and can be used to log into your unifi account**
- If the login didn't work, the script will not be able to check stock for Early Access products.
